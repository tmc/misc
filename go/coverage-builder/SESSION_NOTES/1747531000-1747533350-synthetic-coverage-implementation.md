# Session Notes: Synthetic Coverage Implementation

**Session Period**: May 16, 2025 (approximately 15:30 - 16:55 PST)
**Topic**: Implementing synthetic coverage functionality to add fake files to Go coverage reports (GOCOVERDIR)
**Repository**: github.com/tmc/misc/go/coverage-builder

## Summary

This session focused on implementing a synthetic coverage feature that allows adding fake/artificial coverage data to Go coverage reports. This is useful for including generated code, mocks, vendor libraries, or other files that can't be instrumented during normal test execution.

## Context Setup

1. **Initial Request**: "work on the synthetic coverage idea to add a fake file to a coverage report (GOCOVERDIR)"
2. **Working Directory**: `/Volumes/tmc/go/src/github.com/tmc/misc/go/coverage-builder/`
3. **Existing Structure**:
   - Main coverage builder tool exists
   - A `synthetic-coverage/` directory already present with some initial implementation attempts
   - Template-based wrapper generation for Go versions with coverage

## TODO List (All Completed âœ“)

- [x] Understand current coverage report structure in the codebase
- [x] Research GOCOVERDIR structure and how Go coverage reports work
- [x] Design synthetic file injection mechanism for coverage reports
- [x] Implement fake file addition to GOCOVERDIR coverage reports
- [x] Test synthetic coverage with sample coverage data
- [x] Create example usage with GOCOVERDIR

## Key Files Created/Modified

### Fixed Existing Files
1. **main.go** (line 304)
   - Fixed compilation error by removing unused `extraData` variable
   - Status: Successfully compiled after fix

### Synthetic Coverage Implementation

1. **synthetic-coverage/text-format/main.go** (existing, examined)
   - Simple text format manipulation tool
   - Adds synthetic coverage lines to existing text format coverage files
   - Supports merging and sorting coverage data

2. **synthetic-coverage/main.go** (existing, examined)
   - Binary format manipulation (experimental)
   - Direct GOCOVERDIR manipulation
   - Complex due to hash dependencies and format constraints

3. **synthetic-coverage/README.md** (existing, examined)
   - Explains limitations of binary format
   - Recommends text format approach as simpler solution

### New Documentation Created

1. **synthetic-coverage/USAGE.md**
   - Comprehensive usage guide
   - Two approaches: text format (recommended) and binary format (advanced)
   - Examples for mocks, generated code, and vendor libraries
   - CI/CD integration examples
   - Troubleshooting section

2. **README-synthetic.md**
   - Quick start guide
   - Overview of tools and use cases
   - Integration examples
   - Future enhancements

### Examples Created

1. **synthetic-coverage/examples/add-fake-file.go**
   - GOCOVERDIR integration example
   - Demonstrates full workflow from real coverage to synthetic injection
   - Uses text format approach

2. **synthetic-coverage/examples/gocoverdir-inject.go**
   - Direct binary format manipulation (advanced)
   - Shows internal coverage format handling
   - Experimental approach with limitations

3. **synthetic-coverage/examples/demo.go**
   - Step-by-step demonstration
   - Had path issues initially, fixed to use relative paths

4. **synthetic-coverage/examples/working-demo.go**
   - Complete working example with real tests
   - Creates a test module with go.mod
   - Generates real coverage, adds synthetic, and merges
   - Shows realistic output with percentages

### Test Implementation

1. **synthetic-coverage/test/test.go**
   - Test suite for synthetic coverage functionality
   - Tests text format merging
   - Tests real GOCOVERDIR integration
   - Fixed unused import issue

### Module Configuration

1. **synthetic-coverage/go.mod**
   - Created module definition
   - Set to Go 1.21

2. **synthetic-coverage/go.work**
   - Created workspace file
   - References parent mcp module at `../../../mcp`

## Technical Approach

### Text Format Approach (Recommended)
- Works with standard Go coverage text format
- Simple line format: `file:startLine.startCol,endLine.endCol statements count`
- Easy to merge with existing coverage
- Compatible with most coverage tools

### Binary Format Approach (Experimental)
- Direct manipulation of GOCOVERDIR files
- Complex due to:
  - Meta-data hash dependencies
  - Package and function ID consistency requirements
  - Tight coupling between meta and counter files
- Limited practical use due to complexity

## Key Insights

1. **Text format is superior** for synthetic coverage due to simplicity and compatibility
2. **Binary format** has significant limitations due to hash validation
3. **Use cases** include:
   - Generated code (protobuf, GraphQL schemas, etc.)
   - Mock objects and test doubles
   - Vendor libraries
   - Files excluded from instrumentation

## Integration Points

1. **CI/CD**: Can be integrated into GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.
2. **Local Development**: Can be used during local test runs
3. **Coverage Services**: Compatible with Codecov, Coveralls, etc. (using text format)

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Path Issues**: Initial demos had incorrect relative paths
2. **Coverage Generation**: `go run` doesn't generate coverage; need `go test` or coverage-enabled builds
3. **Binary Format Complexity**: Hash validation makes direct manipulation difficult
4. **Import Issues**: Had to fix unused imports in test files

## Successful Demo Output

The working demo successfully:
1. Created real test coverage (60.0% for main.go)
2. Added synthetic coverage for:
   - `testapp/generated.go` (90% coverage)
   - `testapp/mocks/db.go` (66.7% coverage)
   - `github.com/vendor/lib/util.go` (100% coverage)
3. Merged all coverage into a single report
4. Displayed combined coverage data

## Next Steps Suggestion

When continuing this work:
1. Implement mcpscripttest integration as requested
2. Create test that adds .txt files to coverage
3. Build pattern-based synthetic coverage generation
4. Add configuration file support
5. Create automatic detection of generated files

## File Status Check

All created files should be present and functional. The main areas of work are:
- `/synthetic-coverage/` - Main implementation
- `/synthetic-coverage/text-format/` - Text format tool
- `/synthetic-coverage/examples/` - Working examples
- `/synthetic-coverage/test/` - Test suite

The implementation is complete and tested. The text format approach is proven to work reliably for adding synthetic coverage data.
