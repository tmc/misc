# eslog Development Roadmap

## Real-time Monitoring
- [ ] Add `-F` flag to follow files in real-time (similar to `tail -f`)
- [ ] Implement efficient file watching with minimal resource usage
- [ ] Add auto-reload capability when source files change
- [ ] Support for watching multiple files simultaneously

## Interactive UI
- [ ] Implement bubbletea TUI mode for interactive usage
- [ ] Add color coding for process states (running, completed, failed)
- [ ] Create interactive navigation through process trees
- [ ] Display real-time execution statistics
- [ ] Add process filtering in TUI mode
- [ ] Implement search functionality in TUI
- [ ] Show runtime duration for processes
- [ ] Add highlight mode for specific processes

## Visualization Enhancements
- [ ] Support for exporting process trees as SVG/PNG
