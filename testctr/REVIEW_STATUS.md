# testctr Review Status

## Main Module Status
✅ **github.com/tmc/misc/testctr** - All tests passing
- Core functionality working correctly
- Wait conditions implemented properly
- Container cleanup optimized (2s timeout + kill fallback)
- Log streaming without timeout warnings

## Submodule Status

### ✅ Working Modules
- **backend** - Registry system tests passing
- **backends/cli** - No tests (implementation only)
- **ctropts** - Options packages, no tests needed
- **scripttest** - Integration tests passing

### ⚠️ Modules Needing Updates
1. **testctr-dockerclient** - Panic due to accessing unexported fields
   - Needs update to work with new containerConfig structure
   - Currently trying to access dockerRun field that no longer exists

2. **testctr-testcontainers** - Compilation errors
   - Missing testctr.ContainerInfo type
   - Missing testctrtest.BenchmarkBackend function

3. **testctr-tests** - Not fully tested yet

## Test Coverage
- Main module: 56.1% coverage
- Uncovered areas:
  - DSN functionality (0%)
  - File copying features (0%)
  - Some configuration setters
  - Error handling paths

## Improvements Made
1. Reduced container stop timeout from 10s to 2s
2. Added docker kill fallback for unresponsive containers
3. Fixed log streaming to use test deadline without warnings
4. Made initial log retrieval synchronous for better error reporting
5. Fixed wait condition tests by adjusting timeouts

## Next Steps
1. Update adapter modules to work with new structure
2. Add tests for DSN functionality
3. Add tests for file copying features
4. Consider whether to maintain separate adapter modules
