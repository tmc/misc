# Comments explaining <antthinking> thoughts:

# 1. The sandbox-exec issue seems to be resolved, as the error message is no longer present.
# 2. We need to focus on improving the git-goals scripts and overall functionality.
# 3. The test script (test-git-goals.sh) needs to be updated to reflect the current state of the project.
# 4. We should consider adding more comprehensive error handling and input validation to all scripts.
# 5. The README.md and USAGE.md files should be updated to reflect the current state of the project.
# 6. We should implement any missing git-goals commands (e.g., git-goals-update).
# 7. The overall structure of the project could be improved for better organization.
# 8. We should consider adding more detailed logging or verbose output options.
# 9. The git-goals main script could be enhanced to provide a more user-friendly interface.
# 10. We should ensure consistent formatting and error handling across all scripts.
