# Comments explaining <antthinking> thoughts:

# 1. The sandbox-exec issue seems to be resolved, as the error message is no longer present.
# 2. We need to focus on improving the git-goals scripts and ensuring they work correctly.
# 3. The test script (test-git-goals.sh) needs to be updated to cover all functionalities.
# 4. We should consider adding more robust error handling and input validation to all scripts.
# 5. The README and USAGE files may need updates to reflect any recent changes or additions.
# 6. We should ensure consistent formatting and coding style across all scripts.
# 7. Consider adding more detailed logging or verbose output options for better debugging.
# 8. The git-goals main script could be improved to handle more edge cases and provide better user feedback.
# 9. We should review and potentially optimize the use of git notes for storing goal metadata.
# 10. Consider adding unit tests for individual functions within the scripts to improve reliability.
