# <antthinking thoughts>
# 1. We need to focus on improving the core functionality of git-goals scripts.
# 2. The current implementation lacks proper error handling and input validation.
# 3. We should enhance the user experience by providing more informative output.
# 4. There's an opportunity to improve code organization and reduce duplication.
# 5. We can add new features to make the tool more powerful and flexible.
# 6. It's important to ensure consistency across all git-goals commands.
# 7. We should consider adding more robust testing for each command.
# 8. Documentation improvements would help users understand the tool better.
# 9. We can optimize performance, especially for larger repositories.
# 10. Adding support for configuration options could make the tool more versatile.
