# Git Goals Plugin System

This directory contains plugins for extending the functionality of git-goals.

To create a plugin:
1. Create a new file in this directory with a .sh extension
2. Implement the plugin logic
3. Make sure the plugin is executable (chmod +x your-plugin.sh)

Git Goals will automatically load and execute plugins when appropriate.
