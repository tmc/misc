cat << EOF > OBSERVATIONS
Observations: 

1. The test script is now executing successfully, but there are still some issues to address:

2. The git-goals-create script is working correctly, creating a new goal with an ID and description.

3. The git-goals-list script has been updated to properly retrieve and display stored goals.

4. The test script now successfully extracts the goal ID after creation.

5. The git-goals-show script has been fixed to correctly retrieve and display goal details.

6. The remaining commands (update, complete, report, delete) are now being tested.

7. Error handling and input validation have been added to all scripts to make them more robust.

8. The test script has been updated to handle potential failures more gracefully and provide more detailed error messages.

9. We should consider adding debug output options to help with troubleshooting.

10. The next steps should focus on improving the remaining commands and adding more comprehensive tests.

Next steps:
1. Implement data validation to ensure goal data integrity.
2. Add more comprehensive error handling and input validation to all scripts.
3. Consider adding a debug mode to all scripts for easier troubleshooting.
4. Update the README.md and USAGE.md files to reflect the current state of the project.
5. Add more edge case tests to the test script.
6. Consider adding features like goal prioritization or tagging.
7. Explore integration with other Git workflows or tools.
8. Begin planning for more advanced features like goal dependencies or recurring goals.
9. Implement a way to track goal progress over time.
10. Consider adding a simple visualization tool for goal status and progress.
