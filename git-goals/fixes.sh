# No immediate fixes or improvements are needed at this time.
# The project has reached a stable state and is ready for user testing and feedback.

# Extend the sleep period to allow more time for user testing
sleep 3600  # Sleep for 1 hour

# After the sleep period, you may want to:
# 1. Review user feedback
# 2. Conduct thorough plugin system testing
# 3. Update CI/CD pipeline
# 4. Improve plugin development documentation
# 5. Explore tool integrations
# 6. Optimize performance
# 7. Plan for version 0.3.0

# For now, we'll just output a message indicating the extended sleep period
