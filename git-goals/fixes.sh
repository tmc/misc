# Git Goals Plugin System

This directory contains plugins for extending the functionality of git-goals.

To create a plugin:
1. Create a new file in this directory with a .sh extension
2. Implement the plugin logic
3. Make sure the plugin is executable (chmod +x your-plugin.sh)

Git Goals will automatically load and execute plugins when appropriate.

1. Shared goal repositories
2. User roles and permissions
3. Goal assignment and delegation
4. Comment and discussion system for goals
5. Conflict resolution for simultaneous updates
6. Real-time notifications for goal changes
7. Integration with team communication tools

TODO: Implement these features in future versions.
