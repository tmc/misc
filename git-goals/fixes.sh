# 1. We need to improve error handling and input validation in the git-goals scripts.
# 2. This will enhance the robustness and reliability of the tools.
# 3. We should focus on the core scripts: create, update, list, show, complete, and delete.
# 4. Adding more detailed error messages will help users understand and resolve issues.
# 5. Input validation will prevent unexpected behavior due to incorrect user input.
# 6. We should also consider adding some basic logging for debugging purposes.
# 7. Consistency in error handling across all scripts will improve maintainability.
# 8. We can use functions to centralize common operations and reduce code duplication.
# 9. Adding usage information to each script will improve user experience.
# 10. We should ensure that the scripts handle special characters in goal descriptions properly.
