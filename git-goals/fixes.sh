# Update OBSERVATIONS
cat << EOF > OBSERVATIONS
Observations: 

1. The test script is now executing successfully, but there are still some issues to address:

2. The git-goals-create script is working correctly, creating a new goal with an ID and description.

3. The git-goals-list script has been updated to properly retrieve and display stored goals.

4. The test script now successfully extracts the goal ID after creation.

5. The git-goals-show script has been fixed to correctly retrieve and display goal details.

6. The remaining commands (update, complete, report, delete) are now being tested.

7. Error handling and input validation have been added to all scripts to make them more robust.

8. The test script has been updated to handle potential failures more gracefully and provide more detailed error messages.

9. We should consider adding debug output options to help with troubleshooting.

10. The next steps should focus on thorough testing and potential improvements to the user experience.

Next steps:
1. Implement comprehensive error handling in all scripts.
2. Add debug mode to all scripts for easier troubleshooting.
3. Create more extensive test cases to cover edge cases and potential errors.
4. Improve documentation, including updating the README.md and USAGE.md files.
5. Consider adding features like goal prioritization or tagging.
6. Implement data validation to ensure goal data integrity.
7. Optimize performance for repositories with a large number of goals.
8. Add unit tests for individual functions within the scripts.
9. Consider creating a man page for the git-goals command.
10. Explore integration with other Git workflows or tools.
