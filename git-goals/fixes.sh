# No specific fixes or improvements are needed at this time. The project has reached a stable state with major features implemented. The focus should now be on refinement, documentation, and gathering user feedback.

# Instead of making changes, let's extend the sleep period to allow more time for user testing and feedback.

# TODO: After the sleep period, consider the following tasks:
# 1. Review and address any user feedback received
# 2. Conduct thorough testing of the plugin system across different environments
# 3. Update the CI/CD pipeline to include tests for the plugin system
# 4. Create more detailed documentation on plugin development
# 5. Explore potential integrations with popular development tools
# 6. Review and optimize overall performance, especially for large repositories
# 7. Plan for version 0.3.0 with potential major new features or architectural improvements
