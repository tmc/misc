Observations: 

- The test script is now executing successfully in the sandbox environment
- The git-goals-create script has been implemented and is working
- A USAGE.md file has been added with example usage instructions
- Several other git-goals-* scripts have been implemented (show, delete, update, complete, report, list)
- The make-safe-progress.sh script was added to run tests in a sandbox and analyze results
- An iter script was added to automate the improvement process
- Git notes are being used to store context and analysis results

Next steps:

1. Implement a main git-goals script to dispatch to subcommands
2. Add error handling and input validation to existing scripts
3. Create unit tests for individual git-goals-* scripts
4. Improve documentation, especially for new users
5. Refactor common functionality into shared helper functions
6. Add more comprehensive integration tests
7. Consider adding config options (e.g. custom note ref names)
8. Improve output formatting for better readability
9. Add version information and --version flag
10. Implement data persistence (e.g. using a local database or file)

The codebase is making good progress and most core functionality is implemented. Focus on refining existing scripts, improving error handling, and adding more robust testing. Then move on to user experience improvements and advanced features.
