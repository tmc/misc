Next steps:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Conduct thorough testing of all commands and edge cases using the test-git-goals.sh script.
2. Consider adding more advanced features or integrations, such as goal prioritization or deadline tracking.
3. Improve documentation by creating a comprehensive user guide or man page.
4. Implement unit tests for individual functions to ensure code reliability.
5. Set up a continuous integration pipeline for automated testing and quality checks.
6. Explore options for packaging and distribution, such as creating a Homebrew formula or Debian package.
7. Gather user feedback and iterate on the design and functionality based on real-world usage.
8. Consider adding data visualization features for goal progress and analytics.
9. Explore potential integrations with popular Git hosting platforms or project management tools.
10. Review and optimize performance for larger repositories with many goals.
11. Clean up any remaining "meta-improvement" tools used during the development process.
12. Ensure all documentation (README, USAGE.md, and inline comments) is up-to-date and comprehensive.
