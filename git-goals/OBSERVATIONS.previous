Observations: 

1. The test script is now executing successfully, but there are still some issues to address:

2. The git-goals-create script is working correctly, creating a new goal with an ID and description.

3. The git-goals-list script is functioning, but it's not outputting any goals. This suggests that the goals are not being properly stored or retrieved.

4. The test script fails to extract the goal ID after creation, likely due to a mismatch in expected output format.

5. The git-goals-show script is not producing any output, indicating it's not finding the goal or not properly displaying it.

6. The remaining commands (update, complete, report, delete) are not being tested due to the earlier failure.

7. We need to focus on improving the storage and retrieval of goals using Git notes.

8. Error handling and input validation should be added to all scripts to make them more robust.

9. The test script should be updated to handle potential failures more gracefully and provide more detailed error messages.

10. We should consider adding debug output options to help with troubleshooting.

Next steps:
1. Update git-goals-list to properly retrieve and display stored goals.
2. Modify git-goals-create to output the goal ID in a consistent, easily parseable format.
3. Fix git-goals-show to correctly retrieve and display goal details.
4. Add error handling and input validation to all scripts.
5. Update the test script to better handle and report errors.
6. Implement the remaining commands (update, complete, report, delete) and add tests for them.
7. Consider adding a debug mode to all scripts for easier troubleshooting.
