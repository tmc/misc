10. The test suite covers the new features, ensuring their functionality.

Next steps:

1. Implement the notification system for approaching deadlines, as suggested in the IMPORTANT file.

2. Consider adding more advanced features related to goal management, such as goal dependencies or sub-goals.

3. Explore potential integrations with other development tools or project management systems.

4. Conduct thorough testing of the new features in various scenarios and edge cases.

5. Gather user feedback on the new prioritization and deadline features, and make improvements based on the feedback.

6. Consider implementing data visualization for goal progress and analytics.

7. Evaluate the need for a graphical user interface or web interface for easier goal management.

8. Review and optimize the codebase for performance, especially for repositories with a large number of goals.

9. Consider implementing a plugin system for extensibility, allowing users to add custom features.

10. Plan for the next major version release (e.g., 0.3.0) with a focus on advanced features and integrations.

The project has made significant progress with the addition of prioritization and deadline features. The focus now should be on refining these features, adding more advanced capabilities, and improving the overall user experience.
