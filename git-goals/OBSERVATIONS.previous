Observations: 

1. The goal prioritization and deadline tracking features have been successfully implemented.

2. The CHANGELOG.md has been updated to reflect the new versions (0.2.1 and 0.2.2) with details about the new features.

3. The main git-goals script has been updated to include the new subcommands (prioritize and deadline).

4. New scripts have been added: git-goals-prioritize and git-goals-deadline.

5. Existing scripts (git-goals-list, git-goals-report) have been updated to include priority and deadline information.

6. The README.md and USAGE.md files have been updated with examples of the new commands.

7. The test suite (test-git-goals.sh) has been updated to include tests for the new features.

8. The version number in the main git-goals script has been updated to 0.2.2.

9. The IMPORTANT file has been updated, removing the first two items which were likely related to implementing these features.

10. The implementation appears to be complete and consistent across all relevant files.

Next steps:

1. Thoroughly test the new features to ensure they work as expected in various scenarios.

2. Update the documentation further if needed, especially if any edge cases or additional usage details are discovered during testing.

3. Consider implementing a way to filter or sort goals based on priority and deadline in the list and report commands.

4. Evaluate the need for additional features or improvements based on user feedback or project goals.

5. Review and optimize the codebase for performance and maintainability.

6. Consider implementing automated tests for the new features to ensure long-term stability.

7. Plan for a new release (perhaps 0.3.0) that includes these significant new features.

8. Update the project roadmap or backlog with any new ideas or improvements that came up during this implementation.

9. Consider adding more advanced features related to prioritization and deadlines, such as notifications for approaching deadlines or automatic reprioritization based on deadlines.

10. Review the remaining items in the IMPORTANT file and plan the next development iteration.

The project has made significant progress with the addition of these new features. The focus now should be on testing, refinement, and planning for future enhancements.
