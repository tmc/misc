Observations: 

1. The test script is now executing successfully, but there are still some issues to address:

2. The git-goals-create script is working correctly, creating a new goal with an ID and description.

3. The git-goals-list script has been updated to properly retrieve and display stored goals.

4. The test script now successfully extracts the goal ID after creation.

5. The git-goals-show script is failing to retrieve and display goal details.

6. The remaining commands (update, complete, report, delete) are not being tested yet.

7. Error handling and input validation have been added to all scripts to make them more robust.

8. The test script has been updated to handle potential failures more gracefully and provide more detailed error messages.

9. We should consider adding debug output options to help with troubleshooting.

10. The next steps should focus on fixing the git-goals-show script and implementing the remaining commands.

Next steps:
1. Debug and fix the git-goals-show script to correctly retrieve and display goal details.
2. Implement the update, complete, report, and delete functions.
3. Update the test script to include tests for all implemented functions.
4. Add more comprehensive error handling and input validation to all scripts.
5. Consider adding a debug mode to all scripts for easier troubleshooting.
6. Update the README.md and USAGE.md files to reflect the current state of the project.
7. Implement data validation to ensure goal data integrity.
8. Consider adding features like goal prioritization or tagging.
9. Explore integration with other Git workflows or tools.
10. Begin planning for more advanced features like goal dependencies or recurring goals.
