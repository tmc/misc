5. Start planning for the next major version (e.g., 0.3.0), which could include more substantial features or architectural improvements.

6. Review the project's performance with large repositories or a high number of goals to ensure scalability.

7. Consider enhancing the notification system to integrate more deeply with the priority sorting feature.

8. Explore potential integrations with popular project management or issue tracking systems.
