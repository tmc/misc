Observations: 

- The test script is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This is likely due to an issue with the output format or parsing in the git-goals-create script.

- The git-goals-list script may not be outputting goals in the expected format for the test script to parse.

- We need to update the git-goals-create script to output the goal ID in a consistent, easily parseable format.

- The git-goals-list script should be updated to output goals in a format that matches what the test script expects.

- We should add error handling and input validation to the scripts to make them more robust.

- The test script could be improved to provide more detailed error messages to help with debugging.

- We may want to consider adding a --json flag to the scripts to output machine-readable data for easier parsing and testing.

- The overall structure and flow of the scripts looks good, but they need some refinement to work together properly.

Next steps should focus on fixing the output formats, improving error handling, and getting the basic create/list functionality working before moving on to other commands.
