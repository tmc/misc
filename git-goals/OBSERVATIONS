Observations: 

- The test script is failing when trying to create and list goals. It's unable to extract the goal ID after creation.

- The git-goals-create script seems to be working as it's creating a git note, but the output may not be in the expected format for the test script to parse.

- We need to improve error handling and output formatting in the git-goals-create script.

- The test script should be updated to properly handle the output from git-goals-create.

- We should implement the remaining git-goals commands (show, update, complete, report) to fully test the functionality.

- Consider adding more robust error checking and user-friendly messages throughout all scripts.

- The USAGE.md file should be updated to reflect the current state of the project and provide accurate usage examples.

- We may want to add a main git-goals script that acts as an entry point for all subcommands.

Next steps:
1. Fix the output format of git-goals-create to make it easier to parse
2. Update the test script to properly handle the new output format
3. Implement the remaining git-goals commands
4. Update USAGE.md with accurate information
5. Create a main git-goals script to handle subcommands
