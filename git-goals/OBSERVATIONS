Observations: 

- The test script is failing when trying to create and list goals. It's unable to extract the goal ID after creation.

- The git-goals-create script seems to be working as it's creating a git note, but the output may not be in the expected format for the test script to parse.

- We need to modify the git-goals-create script to output the goal ID in a consistent, easily parsable format.

- The git-goals-list script may also need adjustment to ensure it outputs goals in a format the test script can parse.

- Error handling in the test script could be improved to provide more informative messages.

- We should focus on fixing the goal creation and listing functionality before moving on to other commands.

Next steps:

1. Modify git-goals-create to output the goal ID on a separate line
2. Update git-goals-list to ensure consistent output format
3. Adjust the test script to properly parse the output from these commands
4. Add more robust error handling and logging in the test script
5. Re-run the test script and address any remaining issues
