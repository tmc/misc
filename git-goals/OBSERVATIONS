Observations: 

- The test script is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This indicates an issue with either the goal creation or listing functionality.

- The git-goals-create script seems to be working as it's creating a new goal, but the output may not be in the expected format for parsing.

- The git-goals-list script may not be outputting the goal information in a format that can be easily parsed to extract the goal ID.

- We need to focus on fixing the goal creation and listing functionality to ensure they work together properly.

- Once those core functions are working, we can move on to implementing and testing the other git-goals commands.

- Consider adding more robust error handling and output formatting to make debugging easier.

- We may need to standardize the output format across all git-goals commands to ensure consistency and ease of parsing.

To guide our next steps:

1. Debug and fix the git-goals-create script to ensure it outputs the goal ID in a consistent, parseable format.
2. Update the git-goals-list script to output goals in a format that's easy to parse and extract goal IDs from.
3. Modify the test script to properly parse the output from git-goals-list and extract the goal ID.
4. Add more detailed error messages and logging to help identify issues.
5. Once create and list are working, implement and test the remaining git-goals commands (show, update, complete, delete).
6. Consider adding a verbose mode to all commands for additional debugging information.
