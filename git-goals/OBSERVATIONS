Observations: 

The codebase is focused on implementing a "git-goals" system for managing and tracking goals within Git repositories. Recent changes include:

1. Adding test scripts and improving error handling in existing scripts.

2. Implementing a "make-safe-progress.sh" script that runs tests in a sandbox environment and analyzes the execution context.

3. Creating an "iter" script to automate the improvement process using a plan-do-study-act cycle.

4. Using git notes to store metadata and execution context for each iteration.

5. Improving the system prompt for the AI assistant to better guide the development process.

Key areas for improvement:

1. Enhance error handling and output in git-goals-create and other scripts.

2. Implement missing functionality like git-goals-update and git-goals-delete.

3. Improve test coverage and add more comprehensive test cases.

4. Refine the automated improvement process in the "iter" script.

5. Enhance documentation, including updating USAGE.md with new features.

Next steps:

1. Implement error handling and improve output in git-goals-create script.
2. Create git-goals-update and git-goals-delete scripts.
3. Expand test cases in test-git-goals.sh.
4. Refine the "iter" script to better analyze and apply improvements.
5. Update USAGE.md with new features and improved examples.
