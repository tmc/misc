Observations: 

1. The test script is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This suggests there may be an issue with the output format or parsing in the git-goals-create or git-goals-list scripts.

2. The error occurs in the test-git-goals.sh script, specifically in the line:
   goal_id=

3. The git-goals-create script seems to be working as it outputs the created goal ID and description, but the test script is not capturing this output correctly.

4. We need to modify the test-git-goals.sh script to properly capture and parse the output from git-goals-create.

5. After fixing the goal ID extraction, we should continue implementing and testing the remaining git-goals commands (show, update, complete, delete, report).

6. The overall structure of the test script looks good, but we need to ensure each command is properly tested and error cases are handled.

7. Consider adding more robust error handling and input validation to all git-goals scripts.

8. Once the basic functionality is working, we can focus on improving the user experience and adding any additional features.

9. Regular testing and iterative improvements will be key to developing a robust git-goals tool.

10. Consider adding more detailed logging or debug output options to help troubleshoot issues during development.
