Observations: 

- The test script is failing when trying to create and list goals. It's unable to extract the goal ID after creation.

- The git-goals-create script seems to be working correctly to create a goal, but the output may not be in the expected format for the test script to parse.

- The git-goals-list script exists but may not be outputting goals in the format expected by the test script.

- There are several other git-goals-* scripts implemented (show, update, delete, complete, report) but they are not being tested yet.

- The main git-goals script exists to route subcommands to the appropriate scripts.

- There is a USAGE.md file with example usage, but the actual implementation may not match it exactly yet.

- The test script is running in a temporary directory, which is good for isolation.

- The project structure and basic scripts are in place, but there are still issues to resolve with the core create/list functionality.

Next steps:
1. Debug the git-goals-create and git-goals-list scripts to ensure they output data in a consistent, parseable format.
2. Update the test script to properly parse the output from create and list.
3. Expand the test script to cover the other implemented commands (show, update, delete, complete, report).
4. Ensure all scripts are using consistent data formats and error handling.
5. Update USAGE.md if the actual implementation differs from the examples.
