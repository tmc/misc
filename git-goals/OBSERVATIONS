Observations: 

1. The project has successfully transitioned to version 0.2.0, with placeholders added for new features (goal prioritization and deadline tracking).

2. The CHANGELOG.md has been updated to reflect the new version and upcoming features.

3. Placeholder files (git-goals-prioritize and git-goals-deadline) have been created for the new features.

4. The main git-goals script has been updated to include the new subcommands.

5. README.md and USAGE.md have been updated to mention the new features as "in progress".

6. The IMPORTANT file has been updated with a prioritized list of tasks for further development.

7. The test suite is running successfully after the recent changes.

8. The project structure remains clean and organized.

9. All scripts maintain consistent error handling and input validation.

10. The project is well-prepared for implementing the new features.

Next steps:

1. Begin implementing the goal prioritization feature in git-goals-prioritize.

2. Start working on the deadline tracking feature in git-goals-deadline.

3. Update the test suite (test-git-goals.sh) to include tests for the new features as they are developed.

4. Enhance the documentation (README.md, USAGE.md) with detailed information about the new features once implemented.

5. Consider adding a configuration option for default priority levels and deadline reminders.

6. Implement a way to display goals sorted by priority and/or deadline.

7. Update the git-goals-report script to include priority and deadline information.

8. Consider adding a notification system for approaching deadlines.

9. Ensure cross-platform compatibility by testing on different operating systems as new features are added.

10. Continue to optimize code performance, especially for large repositories with many goals.

The project is making good progress towards version 0.2.0. The focus should now be on implementing the goal prioritization and deadline tracking features, ensuring they integrate well with the existing functionality, and providing a seamless user experience.
