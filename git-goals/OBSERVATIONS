Observations: 

- The test script is failing because it's unable to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This suggests the output format of git-goals-create needs to be adjusted.

- The git-goals-create script has been updated to output the goal ID on a separate line, which should make it easier to parse in the test script.

- The test script (test-git-goals.sh) needs to be updated to properly extract the goal ID from the new output format of git-goals-create.

- Other git-goals scripts (show, update, delete, complete, list, report) have been implemented but haven't been tested yet due to the initial failure.

- The project structure is becoming clearer, with individual scripts for each git-goals subcommand and a main git-goals script to dispatch to the appropriate subcommand.

Next steps:

1. Update test-git-goals.sh to correctly parse the goal ID from the new git-goals-create output format.

2. Run the test script again to verify that goal creation and ID extraction are working correctly.

3. If successful, proceed to test the other git-goals subcommands (show, update, delete, complete, list, report) in the test script.

4. Address any issues found during testing and refine the scripts as needed.

5. Consider adding error handling and input validation to improve robustness.

6. Update documentation (README.md, USAGE.md) to reflect any changes in usage or new features.
