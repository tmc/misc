Observations: 

1. The test script is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This suggests there may be an issue with the output format of the git-goals-create command or how it's being parsed.

2. The git-goals-create script appears to be working as it's creating a new goal, but the output may not be in the expected format for the test script to parse.

3. The git-goals-list command is being called, but it's not clear if it's producing any output. This could be because no goals are being successfully created and stored.

4. The sandbox environment seems to be set up correctly, with the necessary PATH and environment variables configured.

5. The test script is exiting early due to the failure to extract the goal ID, preventing the rest of the tests from running.

To address these issues and improve the codebase, we should:

1. Review and update the git-goals-create script to ensure it outputs the goal ID in a consistent, easily parseable format.

2. Modify the test script to better handle and parse the output from git-goals-create.

3. Add more verbose logging to both git-goals-create and git-goals-list to help diagnose issues.

4. Implement error handling in the git-goals-list script to provide meaningful output even when no goals are present.

5. Update the test script to continue running tests even if one fails, to get a more comprehensive view of the system's current state.

These steps should help identify and resolve the current issues, improving the overall functionality and reliability of the git-goals system.
