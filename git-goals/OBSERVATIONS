Observations: 

- The test script is now executing successfully in the sandbox environment
- The git-goals-create script has been implemented and is working
- A USAGE.md file has been added with example usage instructions
- Several other git-goals-* scripts have been implemented (show, delete, update, etc.)
- An auto-pdsa.sh script was created but then removed
- A make-safe-progress.sh script was added to run tests in a sandbox and analyze results
- The system prompt has been iteratively improved
- An iter script was added to automate the improvement process
- Git notes are being used to store context and analysis results

Next steps:

1. Implement remaining git-goals-* scripts (list, report)
2. Add error handling and input validation to existing scripts
3. Create unit tests for individual git-goals-* scripts
4. Improve documentation, especially for new users
5. Refactor common functionality into shared helper functions
6. Implement a main git-goals script to dispatch to subcommands
7. Add more comprehensive integration tests
8. Consider adding config options (e.g. custom note ref names)
9. Improve output formatting for better readability
10. Add version information and --version flag

The codebase is making good progress but still needs some work to be fully functional and robust. Focus on completing core functionality, then move on to testing, documentation and refinement.
