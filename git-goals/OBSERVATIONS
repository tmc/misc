Observations: 

1. The test script is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This is likely due to an issue with the output parsing in the git-goals-create or git-goals-list commands.

2. The git-goals-create script is creating a new goal, but the output format may not be consistent with what the test script expects.

3. The git-goals-list script may not be properly formatting the output for easy parsing.

4. Error handling in the test script could be improved to provide more informative messages when steps fail.

5. The test script is not reaching the later stages (update, complete, report, delete) due to the early failure.

6. The sandbox environment seems to be working correctly, allowing isolated testing of the git-goals commands.

7. The project structure and basic command implementations are in place, but require debugging and refinement.

8. Consider adding more robust parsing and output formatting to ensure consistency across all git-goals commands.

9. Implement better error handling and logging throughout the git-goals scripts to aid in debugging.

10. Once the initial goal creation and listing are working, focus on testing and refining the remaining commands (update, complete, report, delete).
