Observations: 

Based on the latest sandbox execution and the current state of the project, here are some key observations and suggestions for next steps:

1. The test script (test-git-goals.sh) is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This is likely due to the output format of the git-goals-create script not matching what the test script expects.

2. The git-goals-create script is currently adding goals to a .git-goals file, but the other scripts (list, show, update, delete) are not implemented yet to work with this file format.

3. There's a mismatch between the current implementation (using a .git-goals file) and the original design intention of using Git notes for goal storage.

4. The test script is not properly handling the case where the .git-goals file doesn't exist yet.

5. Error handling and output formatting in the existing scripts could be improved for better user experience and debugging.

Next steps to consider:

1. Refactor git-goals-create to use Git notes instead of the .git-goals file, aligning with the original design intention.

2. Implement the remaining scripts (git-goals-list, git-goals-show, git-goals-update, git-goals-delete) to work with Git notes.

3. Update the test script to work with the new Git notes-based implementation.

4. Improve error handling and output formatting across all scripts.

5. Add more comprehensive tests to cover various scenarios and edge cases.

6. Update the README.md and USAGE.md to reflect the current implementation and usage instructions.

7. Consider adding a git-goals-init command to set up the initial Git notes ref for storing goals.

8. Implement proper parsing of command-line arguments in each script for better flexibility and user experience.

These steps will help align the implementation with the original design, improve robustness, and provide a better user experience for the git-goals tool.
