Observations: 

- The test script is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This indicates an issue with either the goal creation or listing functionality.

- The git-goals-create script seems to be working as it's creating a new goal, but the output may not be in the expected format for parsing.

- The git-goals-list script may not be outputting the goal information in a format that can be easily parsed to extract the goal ID.

- Error handling in the test script could be improved to provide more informative messages about what exactly went wrong.

- The test script is not continuing past the goal creation and listing steps due to the error, so we're not testing the other git-goals commands.

To guide our next steps:

1. Review and potentially modify the output format of git-goals-create and git-goals-list to ensure consistency and ease of parsing.

2. Improve error handling and debugging output in the test script to get more information about why the goal ID extraction is failing.

3. Once the goal creation and listing are working correctly, continue implementing and testing the other git-goals commands (show, update, complete, delete, report).

4. Consider adding more robust input validation and error handling to all git-goals scripts.

5. After fixing the immediate issues, focus on improving the overall user experience and adding any missing features to the git-goals toolset.
