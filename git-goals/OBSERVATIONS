Observations: 

1. The test script is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This indicates an issue with either the goal creation or listing functionality.

2. The sandbox execution environment seems to be working correctly, but the git-goals commands are not functioning as expected.

3. The current implementation uses git notes to store goal information, which is a good approach for maintaining metadata without cluttering the main repository.

4. There are several git-goals-* scripts (create, list, show, update, delete, complete, report) that need to be reviewed and potentially fixed.

5. The test script (test-git-goals.sh) provides a good framework for testing the functionality of the git-goals commands.

6. The USAGE.md file provides examples of how the git-goals commands should work, which can be used as a reference for fixing the implementation.

7. The current focus should be on fixing the git-goals-create and git-goals-list commands to ensure they work correctly together.

8. Once the basic functionality is working, we can move on to implementing and testing the other commands (show, update, complete, delete, report).

9. The project structure is clean, with separate scripts for each command and a main git-goals script that dispatches to the appropriate subcommand.

10. Consider adding more robust error handling and input validation to improve the reliability of the commands.

Next steps:
1. Debug and fix the git-goals-create command to ensure it correctly stores the goal information.
2. Review and fix the git-goals-list command to properly extract and display goal information.
3. Update the test script to provide
