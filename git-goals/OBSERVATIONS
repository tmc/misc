Observations: 

1. The test script is failing due to issues with extracting the goal ID after creation. This needs to be fixed.

2. The git-goals-create script is working, but the output is not being captured properly in the test script.

3. We need to implement the remaining git-goals commands: list, show, update, delete, complete, and report.

4. The USAGE.md file has been added, which is good for documentation.

5. The project structure is improving, but we need to ensure all scripts are executable and properly linked.

6. Error handling and input validation should be improved across all scripts.

7. We should consider adding more comprehensive tests for each command.

8. The sandbox execution environment seems to be working, but we need to ensure it's properly set up for all tests.

9. We should focus on implementing one command at a time, testing it thoroughly before moving to the next.

10. Once all basic commands are implemented and tested, we can look into more advanced features or optimizations.

Next steps:
1. Fix the goal ID extraction in the test script.
2. Implement and test the git-goals-list command.
3. Implement and test the git-goals-show command.
4. Continue with the remaining commands in a similar fashion.
5. Improve error handling and input validation across all scripts.
6. Update USAGE.md as new commands are implemented.
7. Consider adding a main git-goals script that routes to the appropriate subcommand.
