Observations: 

1. The test script is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This is likely due to an issue with the output format or parsing in the git-goals-list command.

2. The git-goals-create command seems to be working as it's creating a new goal, but the list command is not properly displaying or formatting the output.

3. The sandbox environment is set up correctly, and the test repository is being initialized properly.

4. The PATH is set correctly to include the git-goals scripts.

5. The error occurs when trying to extract the goal ID from the list output, suggesting that the list command's output format may need adjustment.

6. The test script is well-structured but needs to be updated to handle the current output format of the git-goals-list command.

7. We should focus on fixing the git-goals-list command to ensure it outputs the goal ID in a consistent and easily parseable format.

8. After fixing the list command, we should update the test script to correctly extract the goal ID from the new output format.

9. Once the list command is fixed, we can proceed with testing the other git-goals commands (show, update, complete, etc.).

10. We should consider adding more error handling and input validation to the git-goals commands to improve robustness.

Next steps:
1. Review and fix the git-goals-list command to ensure it outputs goal IDs in a consistent format.
2. Update the test script to correctly parse the new output format of git-goals-list.
3. Run the test script again to verify that goal creation and listing work correctly.
4. Continue implementing and testing the remaining git-goals commands (show, update, complete, delete, report).
