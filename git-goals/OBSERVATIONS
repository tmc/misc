Observations: 

- The test script is failing when trying to create and list goals. It's unable to extract the goal ID after creation.

- The git-goals-create script seems to be working correctly, but the output may not be in the expected format for parsing in the test script.

- The git-goals-list script exists but may not be outputting goals in a format that can be easily parsed to extract IDs.

- Error handling and output formatting in the scripts could be improved to make debugging easier.

- The test script could use more robust error handling and logging to help identify where exactly it's failing.

- We may need to update the test script to properly parse the output from git-goals-create and git-goals-list.

- Adding more verbose logging throughout the scripts would help with debugging.

- We should focus on getting the basic create and list functionality working before moving on to other commands.

Next steps:
1. Add more verbose logging to git-goals-create and git-goals-list
2. Update the test script to properly parse output from these commands
3. Improve error handling in all scripts
4. Re-run tests and iterate on fixes until create and list are working
