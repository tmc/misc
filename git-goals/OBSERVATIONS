Observations: 

1. The test script is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This suggests there may be an issue with the output format of the git-goals-create command or how it's being parsed.

2. The git-goals-list command doesn't seem to be producing any output, which could be why the goal ID extraction is failing.

3. The sandbox environment appears to be set up correctly, but the git-goals commands are not functioning as expected.

4. The test script is using a run_command function, but its implementation is empty. This could be causing issues with command execution and output capture.

5. The error message suggests that the goal creation was attempted, but the subsequent list operation failed to retrieve the created goal.

6. The test script exits after the first failure, preventing further tests from running.

To guide our next steps:

1. Review and fix the git-goals-create command to ensure it's outputting the goal ID in a consistent, parseable format.

2. Debug the git-goals-list command to understand why it's not producing any output.

3. Implement proper error handling in the git-goals commands to provide more informative error messages.

4. Revise the run_command function in the test script to properly execute commands and capture their output.

5. Consider adding more verbose logging to the test script to help diagnose issues.

6. Once the basic create and list functionality is working, continue implementing and testing the other git-goals commands (show, update, complete, delete).

7. After fixing immediate issues, focus on improving the overall robustness and user experience of the git-goals tool.
