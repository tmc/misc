Observations: 

1. The test script is failing to extract the goal ID after creating a new goal. This indicates an issue with either the goal creation or listing functionality.

2. The git-goals-create script seems to be working as it's creating a new goal, but the output may not be in the expected format for parsing.

3. The git-goals-list script might not be outputting the goal information in a way that can be easily parsed by the test script.

4. There may be an issue with how git notes are being used or read in the git-goals-list script.

5. The test script's error handling and output parsing need improvement to provide more informative error messages.

6. We should focus on fixing the goal creation and listing functionality before moving on to testing other features.

7. It might be helpful to add more verbose output in the git-goals-create and git-goals-list scripts for debugging purposes.

8. We should consider adding error checking in the git-goals-create script to ensure the goal is actually created before returning success.

9. The test script could benefit from better separation of concerns, possibly breaking out the test cases into separate functions.

10. We may need to review and possibly update the USAGE.md file to ensure it accurately reflects the current implementation and expected output format.

Next steps:
1. Debug and fix the git-goals-create and git-goals-list scripts to ensure they work correctly and output information in a consistent, parseable format.
2. Update the test script to better handle and report errors, possibly adding more verbose output for debugging.
3. Once the basic create and list functionality is working, continue implementing and testing the other git-goals commands.
