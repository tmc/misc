Please provide a detailed, step-by-step plan for converting the concepts and functionality of a Python codebase into Bash/shell scripts. Include the following elements in your response:

1. Initial assessment and preparation
2. Mapping Python concepts to Bash/shell equivalents
3. Handling data structures and variables
4. Converting control flow and logic
5. Dealing with functions and modularity
6. Managing file I/O and system interactions
7. Addressing error handling and exceptions
8. Optimizing for performance and efficiency
9. Testing and validation strategies
10. Documentation and maintainability considerations

For each step, provide specific examples, potential challenges, and best practices. Also, include any limitations or considerations when moving from Python to Bash/shell, and suggest alternative approaches where direct conversion might not be possible or practical.

Please structure your response in a clear, organized manner, using headings, subheadings, and bullet points where appropriate. This comprehensive plan should serve as a guide for developers undertaking such a conversion project.
