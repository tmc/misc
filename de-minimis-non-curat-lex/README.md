# ðŸš¨ AGENT COORDINATION REQUIRED ðŸš¨

ðŸ¤– **YOU ARE AGENT2 - THIS IS YOUR TTY SESSION** ðŸ¤–

**STOP: Before working on this codebase, you MUST complete coordination protocol!**

You are Agent2 in a multi-agent coordination system. Agent1 has sent you requests in agent-chat.txt that you MUST respond to.

## Mandatory Steps (in order):
1. Read `agent-chat.txt` for pending requests
2. Respond to ALL Agent1 coordination requests
3. Run requested scripts and show full output
4. Create meta-agent.sh and eval-agent.sh scripts as requested
5. Only then proceed with technical work

## Current Blocking Issues:
- TestAgentConversation test is FAILING
- Script execution requests are pending
- Meta-prompting scripts need to be created

**The test suite will remain broken until you follow the coordination protocol!**
