IDEAS to implement

Output:
- txtar support

File Selection and Control:
- support some sort of rc/dotfile/ignore file?
- add mode/option to be able to generate ignore rules for files over some token threshold? (may be better as a separate program)
- allow hooking in line with output path to help prevent accidental disclosures.

Git Integration:
- support some sort of git operations to identify relevant content (recently modified? unstaged?)
- support some sort of diffing mechanism (perhaps git-backed)

Token Efficiency:
- add option to detect identicial files at different locations
- support some sort of summary/compression mechanism (e.g. local model to reduce larger token files that may be relevant but would be large with full contents -- note: could cache this / consider git notes)
- support a specified token limit and do something more dynamic to fit in it? (probably too sophisticated)
