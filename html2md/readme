html2md converts HTML input to Markdown format.

This command-line tool reads HTML from either standard input or a specified file
and outputs the equivalent Markdown representation. It uses the html-to-markdown
library with the GitHub Flavored Markdown plugin enabled by default.

Usage:

    html2md [-input=<filename>]

The -input flag specifies the input file. If omitted or set to "-", html2md
reads from standard input.

html2md is designed to be simple and composable, following Unix philosophy. It
can be easily integrated into pipelines or scripts for processing HTML content.
