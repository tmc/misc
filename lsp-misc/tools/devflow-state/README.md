# DevFlowState - Intelligent Development State Management

DevFlowState is an innovative tool that captures, understands, and restores complete development context across sessions, branches, and interruptions. It goes beyond simple session restoration to understand and recreate developer mental models.

## Core Innovation

- **Context Serialization**: Captures LSP state, editor context, terminal sessions, and thought processes
- **Intent Recognition**: AI models that understand developer goals and current focus
- **Smart State Restoration**: Recreates not just files but mental context and task state
- **Cross-Device Synchronization**: Seamless context transfer between development environments

## Features

### Context Capture
- Open files and cursor positions
- Uncommitted changes and work-in-progress
- Terminal session state and command history
- LSP server state and diagnostics
- Developer intent and task description

### Smart Restoration
- One-command restoration of exact working state
- AI-generated task summaries and context
- Smooth transition guidance between work streams
- Optimal context switching recommendations

### Cross-Environment Sync
- Seamless state transfer between development setups
- Cloud-based context storage
- Collaborative state sharing
- Device-specific adaptation

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Capture current development state
devflow-state capture --name "auth-refactor"

# List saved states
devflow-state list

# Restore a specific state
devflow-state restore "auth-refactor"

# Auto-capture on git branch switch
devflow-state auto-capture --enable

# Sync states across devices
devflow-state sync --remote
```

### Integration Examples

```bash
# Git integration - auto-capture on branch switch
git config --global alias.switch-capture '!f() { 
    devflow-state capture --auto && git switch "$1"; 
}; f'

# LSP integration - capture with semantic context
devflow-state capture --include-lsp --semantic-analysis

# Terminal integration - capture shell state
devflow-state capture --include-terminal --command-history
```

## Implementation

### Architecture
- **State Capture Engine**: Comprehensive development context serialization
- **Intent Recognition**: AI models for understanding developer goals
- **Storage Backend**: Efficient state storage and retrieval
- **Restoration Engine**: Intelligent context recreation
- **Sync Service**: Cross-device and collaborative synchronization

### LSP Integration
Extends the existing LSP infrastructure:
- Captures LSP server state and diagnostic information
- Integrates with editor sessions for complete context
- Provides context-aware completions and suggestions
- Maintains semantic understanding across sessions

}
```

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
# Build from source
cd tools/devflow-state
go build -o devflow-state

# Install globally
go install ./...

# Add to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Initialize DevFlowState
devflow-state init

# Start working on a project
cd your-project
devflow-state capture --name "initial-state"

# Make some changes, switch branches, etc.
# ... development work ...

# Restore previous state
devflow-state restore "initial-state"
